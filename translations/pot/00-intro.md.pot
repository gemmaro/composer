"Composer is **not** a package manager in the same sense as Yum or Apt are. "
"Yes, it deals with \"packages\" or libraries, but it manages them on a per-"
"project basis, installing them in a directory (e.g. `vendor`) inside your "
"project. By default, it does not install anything globally. Thus, it is a "
"dependency manager. It does however support a \"global\" project for "
"convenience via the [global](03-cli.md#global) command."
